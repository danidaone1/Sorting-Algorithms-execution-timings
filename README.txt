Hello, Mr Adnan Jelani the Great!
I have included both of the bubble sort and STL algorithim in the same git file. Cuz I didnt create two files(reason lazy).
I have included word document That includes code and execution timings. 
I have included my system info(excluding my systeminfo since my repository is public and you might hack my laptop i dont know) . I compiled both of these codes on my laptop.
